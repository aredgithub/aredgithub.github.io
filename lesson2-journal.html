    <em>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</em>
    <br>
    <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
    <br>
    <em>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</em>

    <em>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
    <br>Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: <br>
    <ul>
    <li>cellphone, </li>
    <li>iPod, </li>
    <li>digital camera, </li>
    <li>and a protein bar Just the essentials. </li>
    </ul>
